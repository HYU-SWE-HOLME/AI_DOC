# HOLME
> 한양대학교 2023-2 소프트웨어공학/인공지능 및 응용 프로젝트 (SWE / AI & Applications Project in Hanyang Univ. 2023-2)

## Proposal
  We propose HOLME, an innovative MATTER-based smart home configuration application. HOLME is designed to offer a unique solution for migrating smart home settings.

  HOLME's main objective is providing convenience and replaceability. Hotels generate the QR code that can connect every IOT devices. By scanning that QR code, users can import their original settings to new environment. During the connecting process, if a device does not exist in current environment, HOLME tries to achieve the original configuration by exploiting other devices. If replacement is not possible, HOLME sends push notifications to inform the user about this situation. 
	
  HOLME supports many services via the NUGU AI speaker. Users can issue voice commands to the NUGU AI speaker. They can activate or deactivate pre-configured routines, revise routines, connect or disconnect IoT devices, control IoT devices, and send notifications about the routine replacement process.
  
  Setting smart home configurations and routines every time they move is time-consuming and inconvenient. HOLME simplifies this process by allowing users to easily import their smart home settings, providing them with seamless and connected home environment.
